# Number Guessing Game
A game that generates a random number based on the minimum and maximum number the user enters. The user will guess what the generated random number will be. If the user guessed wrong, the game will give hint whether the guess is too high or too low than the generated random number. The game will keep track on how many times the user attempted to guess the right number and the total number of attempts will be shown after the user guess the right number.

This is the 2nd game/program I created when I was learning C# (10-14-2023)
